                What are the best backpage alternative websites since 2018?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-dark mt-2">
                Backpage (backpage.com) was a very popular free classified
                advertisement posting website in the United States. It launched
                back in 2004 where people were posting different type of ads
                such as real estate, buy/sell/trade, services, jobs, adult
                services, escort ads etc. By the end of 2011, backpage website
                became the second largest free classified advertisement posting
                website in the United States. The simple advertisement posting
                process and user friendly interface made this website so much
                popular among the users from all over the world especially from
                the United States of America, Canada, Australia and United
                Kingdom. Unfortunately, US Government shut down backpage website
                in the early 2018 for SESTA/FOSTA legislation & allegation of
                sex trafficking advertisements in its adult section. Because of
                that, the users of backpage website were no longer able to post
                their free classified advertisements in this most popular
                classified website. To continue advertising for promoting their
                businesses and services on the web, backpage users were forced
                to look for alternative websites. To be honest, there are
                several backpage alternative websites since 2018 where users can
                post their free classified advertisements. Among all of these
                backpage alternative websites or similar to backpage websites,
                only handful of backpage replacement websites out there that are
                actually delivering success to the advertisement posters. To
                name a few sites like backpage classified or alternative to
                backpage website would be: Craigslist, GumTree, YesBackpage
                Classifieds, Geebo, eBackpage, OLX, OneBackpage, ClassifiedAds,
                Bedpage Classifieds, Oddle, Backpage.cam, Tryst, iBackpage,
                Eros, NewBackpage etc. Most of these backpage alternative
                websites will allow you to post your classified advertisements
                for free in different categories and subcategories but due to
                the US laws, only few backpage replacement websites are still
                offering adult section! Adult services and dating services were
                the most popular section of backpage classifieds and people were
                mainly using backpage for its adult services section and dating
                services section. In order to be the best backpage alternative
                websites in 2018-2020, it must have to have adult services &
                dating services section similar to backpage classifieds. If you
                research a bit in the internet, you will find the true backpage
                replacement and the best backpage alternative website since 2018
                is the YesBackpage classifieds because of its easy to use
                interface and simple advertisement posting process just like
                backpage.com. YesBackpage free classified website looks and
                appears exactly like the backpage.com classified website and the
                process of posting advertisements & finding local offers are as
                same as the backpage classified website. Unlike other similar to
                backpage websites, YesBackpage has a very healthy adult services
                section and dating services section and all of these reasons are
                making YesBackpage classified the best backpage alternative
                website since 2018.

                Can I use YesBackpage classifieds as an alternative to

              </h3>

                In short, yes you can use YesBackpage classifieds as an
                alternative to craigslist personals because YesBackpage
                classified is providing the same services and options that you
                were finding in the craigslist personals classified. For years,
                craigslist classified website was the best choice for adult
                advertising. The craigslist personals section far outpaced all
                other sites for getting escorts and adult service providers,
                calls and new clients. In 2011 craigslist shut down its adult
                service section, at one point even branding it "censored". This
                led to the rise of backpage.com as the world's number one place
                to advertise adult services, dating services, escort services
                etc. Now that craigslist no longer has an adult section,

                craigslist personal section. Backpage personals and craigslist
                personals section being taken offline further grew YesBackpage
                in popularity, and the traffic from both advertisers and clients
                continues to grow. Craigslist was hosted and run in the US,
                making them vulnerable to US Laws, and this is why craigslist
                closed its personal section, leaving YesBackpage the new
                craigslist personal section alternative advertisers went to. If
                you have been advertising on craigslist personal section in the
                past, you can easily get adopted with YesBackpage website and
                publish your ads smoothly in the YesBackpage classified website.

                is very much similar to craigslist personals and your
                advertisements will get similar attention from the people all
                over the world who have been using craigslist personal section
                to find adult services, escort services, body rubs etc. Just
                like the advertisement posters in craigslist personals section,

                is why if you were searching for the craigslist personal
                advertisements like adult services, dating services, craigslist
                escorts near you, body rubs nearby then you will find them
